## Project Changes Log

This document outlines the modifications and new features implemented in the NEXORA News project.

### 1. Implement Dynamic Content
- **`scripts/generate-articles.js`:**
    - Added `fs`, `path`, and `axios` imports.
    - Configured `GEMINI_API_KEY` to use an environment variable.
    - Implemented `logError` for consistent error logging.
    - Added `slugify` function for creating URL-friendly slugs.
    - Created `saveArticleMarkdown` function to write article content with front matter to `.md` files in `content/posts`.
    - Developed `generateArticle` function to prompt the Gemini API, parse responses, and save generated articles.
- **`scripts/helpers/markdown.ts` (New File):**
    - Created a utility to read `.md` files from `content/posts`.
    - Parses front matter and converts markdown content to HTML using `remark` and `remark-html`.
    - Provides `getSortedArticlesData` (to retrieve all articles) and `getArticleData` (to retrieve a single article by slug).
    - Installed `remark` and `remark-html` packages.
- **`src/app/page.tsx`:**
    - Modified to fetch and display articles dynamically using `getSortedArticlesData`, replacing hardcoded data.
    - Implemented a check for when no articles are found.
- **`src/app/noticias/[slug]/page.tsx`:**
    - Modified to fetch and display individual article content dynamically using `getArticleData`.
    - `generateStaticParams` now uses `getSortedArticlesData` to generate slugs.

### 2. Improve Article Rendering
- **`@tailwindcss/typography`:**
    - Installed the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin.
    - Configured the plugin in `tailwind.config.ts`.
    - Removed `prose-invert` from `src/app/noticias/[slug]/page.tsx` to ensure correct styling with a white background.

### 3. Newsletter Functionality
- **`src/app/api/newsletter/route.ts` (New File):**
    - Created a new API route to handle POST requests for newsletter subscriptions.
    - Logs the submitted email to the console (placeholder for actual email marketing service integration).
- **`src/components/NewsletterSignup.tsx`:**
    - Modified to send email data to the new `/api/newsletter` endpoint instead of simulating an API call.

### 4. Complete Other Sections
- **`src/app/noticias/page.tsx`:**
    - Modified to be a server component, fetching and displaying all articles dynamically. Removed hardcoded data and client-side category filtering logic.
- **`src/app/opiniao/page.tsx`:**
    - Modified to be a server component, fetching all articles and filtering them by `category === 'Opinião'`. Displays filtered articles dynamically.
- **`src/app/reviews/page.tsx`:**
    - Modified to be a server component, fetching all articles and filtering them by `category === 'Reviews'`. Displays filtered articles dynamically.
- **`src/app/tutoriais-e-dicas/`:**
    - Refactored into a server component (`page.tsx`) and a client component (`_tutoriais-e-dicas-client.tsx`).
    - The server component fetches all articles and passes them as props to the client component.
    - The client component filters articles into "Tutoriais" and "Dicas" categories and displays them using tab functionality.
- **`src/app/sobre-nos/page.tsx`:**
    - Reviewed and confirmed existing content is appropriate for an "About Us" page. No changes were required.
- **`src/app/video/page.tsx`:**
    - Reviewed and confirmed existing hardcoded video content and display structure are appropriate for a video section. No changes were required for dynamic content at this stage.

All planned enhancements have been implemented, making the website more dynamic and functional.
